# Global Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Tax Database

## Introduction
The Global SSB Tax Database is an open-source repository that provides comprehensive data on sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax designs worldwide. It serves as a valuable resource to support research, inform policy decisions, and guide the development of best practices for SSB taxation.

## Accessing the Database
- You can access and download the full SSB tax database directly from this GitHub repository. 
- The database is also available on the World Bank Data Catalog: [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063310).
- Explore interactive data visualizations, maps, and stories ([#1 Introducing the SSB database](https://ssbtax.worldbank.org/story-one), [#2 SSB tax coverage](https://ssbtax.worldbank.org/story-two), [#3 SSB tax designs](https://ssbtax.worldbank.org/story-three)) built based on the latest database on the [Global SSB Tax Landing Page](https://ssbtax.worldbank.org/).

## Methodology
Transparency in our methodology of data collection and cleaning is a fundamental principle of this repository. We prioritize accuracy and rigorously validate the data to provide reliable information to researchers, policymakers, and the public. Our process for identifying potential SSB taxes and cleaning the data is documented in the [Wiki](../../wiki) page to ensure openness and reproducibility.

## Contributing to the Database
We welcome contributions from the community to keep the SSB tax database up-to-date and relevant. You can contribute in the following ways:

1. **GitHub Issues:**
   - Use GitHub issues to report new SSB taxes or suggest updates to existing ones.
   - Follow the existing issue templates to ensure all necessary information is included.
   - Feel free to ask questions or seek clarifications related to the database.

2. **Pull Requests:**
   - While users are encouraged to submit pull requests, we understand that accurately updating the database may require more effort.
   - Minor updates or corrections can be submitted through pull requests.
   - For significant changes, consider creating an issue for discussion first.

We regularly review the issue page, validate the reported data, and update the database accordingly. Different branches indicate different versions of the database. The most updated version is on the `main` branch.
