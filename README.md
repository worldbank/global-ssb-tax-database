# Global SSB Tax Database repository

## Introduction
This is the repository for the Global SSB Tax Database. It provides background information on the project as well as all of the project files, including current and archived versions of the Database, and the codebook.

The database can also be accessed through the [World Bank Data Catalog](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063310).

We also encourage you to explore the interactive data visualizations, maps, and stories at the [Global SSB Tax Database Landing Page](https://ssbtax.worldbank.org/).

## About the Project
The Global SSB Tax Database is an open-access source of data on all sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes worldwide. It is aimed at supporting research, informing policy decisions, and guiding the development of best practice in SSB tax design.

The Database was developed and is maintained by a team led by Kate Mandeville (Senior Health Specialist, HEAHN), with data collection and analysis by Libby Hattersley (Nutrition Specialist). The work was funded by the World Bank Groupâ€™s Tackling of Non-Communicable Diseases Challenges in Low- and Middle-Income Countries Multi-Donor Trust Fund (Trust Fund No. 072759), supported by Access Accelerated. Web development and data visualizations were created by Data Whale, with support from the World Bank Cartography Unit, Development Economics Group, External and Corporate Relations, and ITSES.

## Using the repository
The repository has two folders containing all versions of the Database (Database folder) and supporting documents (Support folder). Supporting documents include the codebook and methods document. The approach taken to develop and update the project is also summarized in the [Wiki](../../wiki) page.

## Contributing to the Database
We welcome contributions from the community to keep the Database up-to-date and relevant. You can contribute in the following ways:

1. **GitHub Issues:**
   - Use GitHub issues to report new SSB taxes or suggest updates to existing ones.
   - Follow the existing issue templates to ensure all necessary information is included.
   - Feel free to ask questions or seek clarifications related to the database.

3. **Pull Requests:**
   - While users are encouraged to submit pull requests, we understand that accurately updating the database may require more effort.
   - Minor updates or corrections can be submitted through pull requests.
   - For significant changes, consider creating an issue for discussion first.

We regularly review the issue page, validate the reported data, and update the database accordingly. Different branches indicate different versions of the database. The most updated version is on the `main` branch.
